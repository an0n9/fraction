Fraction
========

A machine learning content aggregator built with Meteor.

## What?

Content aggregators are a huge part of the web, delivering the latest news and acting as a social hub for communities like [reddit](http://reddit.com/), [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com),  [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com), and [Digg](http://digg.com/). While each of these has a different style and flavor of delivering the news, Fraction is being built with a few major differences:

* **You're in control.** Instead of giving you content that appeals to the lowest common denominator, your feed is personally tailored to show you content that's recommended by people who like the same things that you do.
* **Censorship is ██ing evil.** You have the right to decide which content you want to see. The only content that will ever be moderated is content that contains malicious code – although every effort is being put in place to make sure this can't happen.
* **It's your data.** You can make the decision to download and delete all of your data whenever you'd like. If you ever feel that you can't trust Fraction with your personal data, you should be able to remove it immediately and permanently from the server.

## When?
Fraction officially launches June 4th, 2014 – although the [demo](https://demo.fraction.io) will always have the latest code for you to test-drive.

## Where?

I'm writing a blog post every day on the [Fraction blog](https://blog.fraction.io/) to summarize what I've finished (and any hurdles), as well as keeping the [Fraction demo](https://demo.fraction.io/) updated with the most recent changes.

## Why?
1. We have the technology, and there's no reason to make people do [shit work](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/).
2. Content aggregators are prone to manipulation by people with money, authority, and bad intentions.
3.
